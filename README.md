Welcome to the Michigan Hackers website! This site requires that you install the latest stable version of Node.

### How to run
First, install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) (`npm` is a dependency of `yarn`, so install `npm` first if necessary). Clone down this repository to a location of your choice, and run `yarn`.
Then run
`yarn start`
and get going!

To run tests, run `yarn test`.

To run tests and create a build (i.e.for the purpose of deployment), run `yarn build`.
